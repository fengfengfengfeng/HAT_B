# HAT_B

This is the final project for Body-Centric Technologies Course by Prof. Kate Hartman Project by Yiyi Shao and Feng Yuan

We embed digital components into two knit hats and want to use our hats to expand the body movement particularly on the head, and to furthur talk about social activities in daily life.

For this version of hat, we sew a pressure sensor into the hat by using conductive thread and press sensing fabric. A led string was sewed all around the hat,and we are using embedded mircrophone, sound sensor and accelerometer sensor circuit playground
